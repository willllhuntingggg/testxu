# # Welcome to the [macOS Panda Alpha](https://bear.app/alpha/)
Thanks for checking out this early peek into the future of Bear. With this alpha test‚Äîcode named Panda‚Äîwe‚Äôre focusing on some major new features for the Editor **inside** of Bear. That means some of its other major components like tags and the Sidebar aren‚Äôt here yet. Eventually, we‚Äôll get them in here too. 

We‚Äôd love to hear your [feedback](https://beta.bear.app/c/feedback/5) and [bug reports](https://beta.bear.app/c/bug-reports/6). Now, check out the list of what‚Äôs new and how to use some of these features.

### Markdown, ==improved==
* Bear is switching from Polar to [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org), a more standard and compatible version of Markdown for adding style to plain text
* Markdown is now hidden by default when not editing, making for a cleaner look and easier reading
* Nest styles to combine things like *[italics and links](https://bear.app/alpha/)* or add #tags and links to headers

### Tables
Tables are coming to Bear! Create them from the top toolbar in Panda, and mouse over a cell for more options.

| üê∏ Shiny Frog | Less Snuggly     | [The Team](http://shinyfrog.net) |

### Footnotes
Footnotes are a great way to include tertiary information, cite sources, or expand on a related topic, like this[^1]. To navigate to a footnote, click its number like the one here [^2].

### Better tools to work with #images
Hover the mouse on the bottom right corner of an image (like the one below) to resize it.

Oh, and click GIFs to play them!

### Folding
Focus on a section of a note by folding (hiding) others. To fold a part of a note, click on a header‚Äôs icon, then choose Toggle Folding. To reveal a folded section, click the (...) button at the end of its name. Try it on the folded section below.

#### Here‚Äôs a folded section you can play with
Peekaboo!
